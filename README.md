# Allegiant Email Ad

## Description:
This project is a mock-up of an email ad I received from Allegiant Airlines.  The purpose for recreating this ad was to display my ability and skills to create a functioning email(er) that is mobile responsive using only HTML and CSS.  No frameworks were used in the development of this ad, nor were any media queries.
<br />
This example showcases my ability to bring a UX design to life...from start to deployment.
